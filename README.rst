Semantics with our Plugins
==========================

Semantics with our Plugins is the concept of using semantic web technologies to describe our software plugins in order to make them discoverable and reusable. Currently this repository contains a web application for searching, discovering, and annotating plugins used in `MAP Client <https://map-client.readthedocs.io>`_ and our CTK-based applications.
